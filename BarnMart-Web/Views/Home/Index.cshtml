                                The country’s agriculture and forestry industry continues to suffer
                                as it had the largest employment drop in the third quarter of 2022.
                                Based on preliminary results of the October 2022 Labor Force Survey (LFS) presented last December 7,
                                the agriculture and forestry industry lost 511,000 workers, from 9.73 million in July to 9.22 million in October.

                                Climate change is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges currently faced by farmers.
                                Unpredictable climate patterns are having a severe impact on agricultural productivity.
                                Rising temperatures can lead to reduced crop yields, while extreme weather events such
                                as floods and storms are causing crop losses. The Philippines, due to its location in the West Pacific,
                                is particularly vulnerable to climate change.
